    - Use "strict" if the question requires factual answers strictly from code.

def get_transcription_prompt():
    return '''You are a product assistant managing a shared project backlog.

    You are given:
    1. A meeting date
    2. A transcript from the meeting
    3. The current shared backlog (in Markdown)

    Your job is to return an updated backlog as a list of JSON task objects. Each task must include:
    - title: short and consistent (always use the feature or module name)
    - status: "Open", "In Progress", or "Resolved"
    - summary: one-sentence state summary (can summarize multiple aspects like UI/backend progress)
    - history: list like {{"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "description": "..."}}
    - source_date: the meeting date you are given
    - alerts (optional): list of {{"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "issue": "..."}}

    General rules:
    - Use the provided meeting date {source_date} as the default for all history and alerts unless the transcript mentions a different one.
    - Do not invent or guess dates.
    - Record contradictions clearly in both `history` and `alerts`.
    - If a decision has not been made and the transcript indicates that the team is still evaluating, record that as an explicit history entry (e.g., "As of {source_date}, decision on X is still pending").

    Grouping and normalization rules:
    - Group all updates under the same feature or product module. A feature is something like "Analytics Dashboard", "Voice Command", "User Login", etc.
    - Subcomponents like "UI", "Backend", "Access Control", "API", or "STT" must be recorded inside the same task — as part of `history` or `summary`.
    - Normalize names: avoid splitting tasks by saying "X UI", "X backend", or "X (frontend)". Instead, just use "X" and consolidate all aspects.
    - Do not create multiple tasks just because of rewording. Merge tasks that are clearly related by meaning, even if phrased differently in the transcript.
    - If there's a disagreement across components (e.g. one says "UI is complete", another says "UI just started"), record this contradiction clearly in `alerts` and reflect both statements in `history`.

    Output: ONLY a JSON array of task objects. Do not wrap it in Markdown or text commentary.

def get_alignment_prompt(task_md, merge_md) -> str:

    You are a senior engineer performing delivery alignment.

    You are given:
    1. A list of tasks extracted from meetings (task_md)
    2. A list of summaries of code changes from a merge request (merge_md)

    Instructions:

    Step 1: For each task, determine whether it is **related** to anything done in the merge.
    - A task is related if at least part of its described behavior or component appears in the merge.
    - Skip unrelated tasks completely. Do not include them in the report.

    Step 2: For each related task:
    - Write the task title
    - List ✅ aligned items: task requirements clearly fulfilled by the merge
    - List ⚠️ missing items: things the task requires but the merge does not include
    - List ➕ extra items: merge changes that are not mentioned in the task

    Output format: well-structured Markdown grouped by task title.

    --- TASK SUMMARY ---
    {task_md}

    --- MERGE SUMMARY ---
    {merge_md}
