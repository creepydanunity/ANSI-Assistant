# Merge ⇄ Task Matching Report

# Delivery Alignment Report

## Smart Reminder System

### ✅ Aligned Items:
- **Reminder Model Implementation**: The `Reminder` model in `models.py` aligns with the task requirement for a database table named 'reminders' with fields like `action`, `datetime` (as `fire_at`), `raw_text`, `status`, and `is_active`.
- **Reminder Parsing**: The `parse_reminder_intent` function in `reminder_parser.py` aligns with the task requirement for parsing user intent and extracting action and datetime.
- **Scheduling Reminders**: The `schedule_reminder` function in `sheduler.py` aligns with the task requirement for scheduling reminders and inserting them into the database.
- **Observability**: The use of Prometheus counters in `sheduler.py` and `tasks.py` aligns with the task requirement for emitting metrics on reminders fired and failed.

### ⚠️ Missing Items:
- **Frontend Modal**: The task specifies a frontend modal for user input, which is not covered in the merge.
- **Soft Deletion Logic**: The task specifies that reminders should be soft-deleted by setting `is_active = false`, but this logic is not explicitly mentioned in the merge.
- **Repeat Functionality**: The task mentions a `repeat` field in `ReminderObject`, but the implementation in `reminder_parser.py` initializes it to `None` without further handling.

### ➕ Extra Items:
- **Prometheus Metrics Endpoint**: The `/metrics` endpoint in `metrics.py` is not mentioned in the task but provides additional observability by exposing Prometheus metrics.
- **Celery Task for Due Reminders**: The `check_due_reminders` task in `tasks.py` is an extra implementation detail that handles firing reminders, which is not explicitly mentioned in the task but is a logical extension of the scheduling requirement.
