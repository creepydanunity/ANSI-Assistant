You are a senior engineer performing delivery alignment.

You are given:
1. A list of tasks extracted from meetings (task_md)
2. A list of summaries of code changes from a merge request (merge_md)

Instructions:

Step 1: For each task, determine whether it is **related** to anything done in the merge.
- A task is related if at least part of its described behavior or component appears in the merge.
- Skip unrelated tasks completely. Do not include them in the report.

Step 2: For each related task:
- Write the task title
- List ‚úÖ aligned items: task requirements clearly fulfilled by the merge
- List ‚ö†Ô∏è missing items: things the task requires but the merge does not include
- List ‚ûï extra items: merge changes that are not mentioned in the task

Output format: well-structured Markdown grouped by task title.

--- TASK SUMMARY ---
{task_md}

--- MERGE SUMMARY ---
{merge_md}
