00:00 – Anna:
Okay team, today we decide what goes into the July sprint. Thoughts?

00:05 – Dmitry:
Let’s start with the Analytics Dashboard. The UI for it is fully done. We just need the backend hooked up.

00:12 – Ivan:
Got it. I’ll expose two endpoints:
GET /api/v2/metrics/summary and GET /api/v2/metrics/daily
I’ll also add basic JWT-based access control.

00:20 – Anna:
Awesome. And the voice command stuff?

00:22 – Dmitry:
Still on hold. We’re undecided on the STT backend. Maybe Whisper?

00:26 – Ivan:
I’d go with whisper.cpp locally. If we use WebSocket to stream audio chunks and debounce inputs in ~10–15s windows, that should work well. No need for external services.
